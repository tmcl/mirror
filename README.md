# mirror
reflex-mirror = Reflex.Win32, bindings between Reflex and Win32

A binding between Reflex (0.7.0) and Win32. Requires a custom branch of Win32 (for extra 
bindings - these should mostly get merged back into Win32 but I haven't got around to 
filing the pr's yet), see the included submodule.

## Install
Install `choco`/Chocolatey first.

Then you should be able to do:

```powershell
(as admin)
choco install --version 8.8.3 ghc
choco install haskell-dev

(as regular user in a fresh shell)
cabal new-build counter
```

Since many things transitively depend on `Win32`, it will rebuild a lot of things. 

I encounter a problem rebuilding `time`, complaining that it cannot find `HsTimeConfig.h`. 
The file is generated in `dist-newstyle/.../time-1.9.3/lib/include` but it only 
looks for it in the source. I work around that by copying it into the source manually,
see below. (Probably caused by https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5223 which
is fixed, but perhaps the fix hasn't got into ghc 8.8.3.)

```powershell
cabal get time-1.9.3
notepad cabal.project # append time-1.9.3
notepad time-1.9.3/time.cabal # delete all tests, since the cause a circular dependency
cp $env:PATH/dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-windows/ghc-8.8.3/time-1.9.3/build/lib/include/HsTimeConfig.h time-1.9.3/lib/include
```

Obviously, this requires you to build it twice: once it will fail but it will 
produce the HsTimeConfig.h file so you can copy it, and then you can use it.

It seems like there should be other ways to get that to work 
e.g. --extra-include-dirs, but I wasn't able to get that to work.

## other things, limitations etc
See the README.md in the package for more relevant info.

## Reflex.Host.Basic

Reflex.Host.Basic was invaluable in this process. I converted the Host1..5.hs files 
into Win32 to help me get there. Whether they still compile or not, I do not know, 
but they are included in the reflx-host-basic-Win32 folder for reference.
